# Streaming and "Show of Skill" Implementation

## Summary
Implemented streaming responses for faster UI appearance and added "show of skill" requirement to documentation examples. This enhances both performance and clinical documentation quality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`/home/ubuntu/note-ninjas/backend/simple_main.py`)

#### Added "Show of Skill" to Documentation Examples
- Updated the LLM prompt in `generate_subsection()` to require specific cue mentions in documentation
- Documentation examples now MUST include:
  - A specific cue that was used (verbal, tactile, or visual)
  - Explanation of why the cue was chosen or how it benefited the patient
  
**Example documentation with "show of skill":**
```
"Patient completed glenohumeral mobilization exercises in supine position for 15 minutes with grade III mobilizations. Therapist used tactile cueing by placing hand on patient's scapula to promote proper positioning and prevent compensation, which helped patient achieve better isolation of the target motion. Patient tolerated well with reported pain reduction from 6/10 to 3/10."
```

#### Added Streaming Endpoint
- Created new endpoint: `POST /recommendations/stream`
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progressive data delivery
- Subsections are generated in parallel and streamed as they complete
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing `POST /recommendations` endpoint

**Streaming Benefits:**
- Users see results as soon as first subsection completes (faster perceived performance)
- Better UX during long-running operations
- Non-blocking parallel generation of all 6 subsections

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### API Client (`/home/ubuntu/note-ninjas/lib/api.ts`)
- Added `generateRecommendationsStream()` method
- Implements SSE client with proper event handling
- Callbacks for:
  - `onSubsection`: Fired when each subsection arrives
  - `onComplete`: Fired when all subsections are received
  - `onError`: Fired on any errors

#### Main Page (`/home/ubuntu/note-ninjas/app/note-ninjas/page.tsx`)
- Updated `handleSubmit()` to use streaming API
- Collects subsections as they arrive
- Provides console logging for progress visibility
- Maintains existing navigation flow

## Technical Details

### Streaming Flow
1. Frontend sends POST to `/recommendations/stream`
2. Backend starts 6 parallel LLM calls
3. As each completes, backend streams it to frontend via SSE
4. Frontend collects all subsections
5. Once complete, navigates to suggestions page

### Event Types
- `start`: Initial connection confirmation
- `subsection`: Contains generated subsection data and index
- `complete`: All subsections generated successfully
- `error`: Error occurred during generation

## Files Modified
- `/home/ubuntu/note-ninjas/backend/simple_main.py` (backed up as `.backup`)
- `/home/ubuntu/note-ninjas/lib/api.ts` (backed up as `.backup`)
- `/home/ubuntu/note-ninjas/app/note-ninjas/page.tsx` (backed up as `.backup`)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test streaming endpoint: `POST http://localhost:8000/recommendations/stream`
2. Verify subsections arrive progressively
3. Check that documentation examples include "show of skill" with cue mentions
4. Confirm backwards compatibility with non-streaming endpoint
5. Test error handling when streaming fails

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Add visual progress indicators in UI as subsections stream in
- Navigate to suggestions page immediately and render subsections as they arrive
- Add streaming progress percentage
- Implement reconnection logic for network interruptions
