## Date: October 14, 2025

## Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/simple_main.py`)
- ✅ **RAG System**: Disabled (confirmed `rag_system_ready: false`)
- ✅ **Model**: GPT-4o with parallel processing (6 simultaneous API calls)
- ✅ **Speed**: Reduced from 35s to ~34s with parallel calls
- ✅ **Exercise Generation**: 
  - 6 subsections generated in parallel
  - 2-3 patient-specific exercises per subsection
  - Exercises tailored to patient condition and treatment goals
- ✅ **Exercise Details**:
  - Detailed descriptions (2-3 sentences)
  - 3 detailed cues per exercise (1-2 sentences each: Verbal, Tactile, Visual)
  - 1 comprehensive documentation example
  - CPT billing codes with notes
  - Clinical contraindications
- ✅ **Exercise Names**: Naturally mentioned in subsection descriptions for purple highlighting

### Frontend (`app/note-ninjas/suggestions/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Exercise Display**: Exercises highlighted in purple within descriptions
- ✅ **Clickable Exercises**: Clicking exercise names opens detailed modal
- ✅ **Exercise Modal**: Shows full exercise details:
  - Exercise description
  - Detailed cues (Verbal, Tactile, Visual)
  - Documentation examples
  - CPT billing codes
  - Clinical notes
- ✅ **UI/UX**: No layout changes, preserved original design
- ✅ **Clean Interface**: Removed exercise list below cards (exercises only in descriptions)

## API Performance
- **Response Time**: ~34 seconds
- **Parallel Processing**: 6 subsections generated simultaneously
- **Quality**: GPT-4o ensures professional clinical content
