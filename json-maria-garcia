  "InsuranceProvider": "Medi-Cal",
  "DateOfService": "2025-08-19",
  "Subjective": {
    "ChiefComplaint": "Chronic low back pain with recent increase in intensity, affecting mobility.",
    "HistoryOfPresentIllness": "Patient has a 10-year history of low back pain, related to degenerative disc disease (per past MRI showing L4-L5 disc bulge). Pain has worsened over past 3 months after an episode of lifting a heavy box at home. Reports constant dull ache in lower back (lumbar area) with intermittent sharp pains radiating slightly into right buttock (no below-knee radiation). No new numbness or weakness noted, but states balance feels off and she has stumbled a few times. Has not been to PT in several years. Primary care physician referred to PT to prevent decline and avoid possible need for surgery. Pain is limiting her in walking and household chores.",
    "PainLevel": "Baseline 5/10, up to 7/10 with prolonged standing or lifting. Better (3/10) when lying down.",
    "PainDescription": "Aching across low back, stiffness in the morning. Sharp twinge in right low back/hip area when bending forward or standing >10 minutes. Uses heating pad daily which helps somewhat.",
    "AggravatingFactors": "Bending forward, lifting anything >10 lbs, standing or walking >15 minutes, climbing stairs.",
    "EasingFactors": "Rest, heat, gentle stretching, changing positions frequently.",
    "AssistiveDevices": "Uses a single-point cane for long walks (for balance confidence). No brace.",
    "PastMedicalHistory": "Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity (BMI ~32). No surgeries on spine. Has mild diabetic peripheral neuropathy (feet numbness). No falls, but feels unsteady at times.",
    "Medications": "Metformin, Atenolol, Gabapentin (for neuropathy), Acetaminophen as needed for back pain (takes daily).",
    "FunctionalStatus": "Lives alone, independent in self-care but slow. Cannot stand long enough to cook full meals - needs breaks. Limits shopping trips due to back pain and fatigue. Walks with short distances only; uses motorized cart in big stores. No longer participates in church activities that require standing or walking. Reports difficulty getting out of low chairs or bathtub due to back and leg weakness.",
    "PatientGoals": "Decrease back pain to allow her to walk in her neighborhood at least 30 minutes and do household chores (like cooking, light cleaning) without frequent breaks. Improve balance to reduce fear of falling. Wants to be able to attend her granddaughter’s events which require walking and standing."

    "Neurologic": "Light touch slightly decreased in feet (worse on right, due to diabetic neuropathy). Reflexes: 1+ Achilles bilaterally, 2+ patella. No acute radicular signs; negative straight leg raise. Balance: Romberg test mildly positive (sway present, eyes closed).",
    "SpecialTests": {
      "SLR": "Negative for radicular pain (tight hamstrings noted).",
      "FABER": "Bilateral positive for low back/glute discomfort (likely SI/lumbar contribution, not true hip joint issue).",

      "TimedUpAndGo": "16 seconds (using cane). Slightly above fall-risk threshold for her age (normal ~<12s).",

      "5RepSitToStand": "Took 20 seconds, used arms to assist (indicates leg and core weakness)."

  "Assessment": {
    "Diagnosis": "Chronic low back pain with lumbosacral spondylosis (ICD-10: M47.816) and deconditioning. Impaired balance and functional mobility.",
    "ClinicalImpression": "60-year-old female with chronic mechanical low back pain, now exacerbated by decreased activity and core weakness. Contributing factors include poor core strength, limited lumbar mobility (especially extension), obesity increasing spinal load, and possibly tight hip flexors. Also presents with mild balance impairment likely due to a combination of deconditioning and peripheral neuropathy. Deficits in functional mobility (slow gait, difficulty rising from chair). She demonstrates fear of movement (fear-avoidance behavior) due to pain. Prognosis: Fair - improvements expected in pain and function with therapy, though chronic nature and comorbidities (diabetes, obesity) may limit full resolution. Goals will focus on pain management, improving strength/flexibility, and safety with mobility. Will coordinate care with PCP as needed (for pain management and any medical clearance for exercise)."
  },
  "Plan": {
    "TreatmentPlan": "Begin PT 2x/week for 12 weeks focusing on therapeutic exercise and functional training. Plan: **Pain Management/Modalities** – Use moist heat to lumbar region 10 min at start of sessions to reduce stiffness; incorporate TENS during sessions if needed for pain relief during exercise. **Therapeutic Exercises** – Core stabilization program (guided pelvic tilts, transverse abdominis activation, progressing to abdominal bracing, gentle lumbar stabilization exercises like dead bug or bird-dog modified as able). Stretching for lower back and hips (hamstring, hip flexor stretches) to improve flexibility. **Aquatic Therapy** – initiate exercises in warm water pool 1x/week if available to allow low-impact strengthening and conditioning (water walking, gentle pool exercises to improve endurance) – this will reduce weight-bearing stress and may increase her confidence. **Strength Training** – focus on gluteals, hip abductors, and quadriceps (sit-to-stand practice, step-ups, theraband side steps) to improve support for back and balance. Gradual progressive resistance as tolerated (start with isometrics and gravity exercises, progress to resistance bands). **Neuromuscular Re-education** – balance and proprioception exercises: static balance training (tandem stance, single-leg stance with support), progressing to dynamic balance (walking on foam, obstacle courses) to reduce fall risk. Gait training emphasizing upright posture and proper use of cane (ensure appropriate cane height and pattern). **Body Mechanics and Education** – Teach proper bending/lifting techniques (e.g. squat vs. stoop), pacing strategies for activities, ergonomics for home (e.g. raised toilet seat if needed, safe tub transfer techniques). Home exercise program will be provided (daily gentle stretching, activation exercises, walking schedule starting with 5-10 minutes and gradually increasing). Will also encourage weight loss through daily walking and refer to nutrition resources as appropriate. **Coordination of Care** – Ensure compliance with physician’s plan; request updated prescription if more therapy needed beyond Medi-Cal limits and justify with functional gains. Plan to periodically reassess outcome measures (TUG, sit-to-stand) to track improvement.",
    "ShortTermGoals": [
      "Decrease reported low back pain from 5/10 to 3/10 with basic activities (walking, standing) in 4 weeks.",
      "Increase lumbar flexion range from 50% to 75% of normal (able to reach mid-shin) in 4-6 weeks with less pain.",
      "Improve Timed Up & Go to <12 seconds (fall risk cutoff for her age) in 6 weeks.",
      "Be able to rise from a chair independently without using arms in 6 weeks."
    ],
    "LongTermGoals": [
      "Patient to walk 30 minutes continuously on level surface with minimal pain (<=2/10) in 12 weeks.",
      "Demonstrate independent performance of a core stabilization routine and proper body mechanics for lifting light objects by 12 weeks.",
      "Improve lower extremity strength to 4+/5 and dynamic balance (e.g., safely negotiate community environments, curbs, uneven ground) in 12 weeks.",
      "Reduce fear of falling – patient to report increased confidence (e.g., improved Activities-specific Balance Confidence score) and have no falls through course of therapy."
    ],
    "FrequencyDuration": "2 times per week for 12 weeks (24 visits). Will request prior authorization as required by Medi-Cal for continuation beyond initial eval. Monthly progress notes will be sent to physician and Medi-Cal reviewer to justify ongoing care. Plan includes re-evaluation at 4 weeks and 8 weeks to update goals and ensure medical necessity is demonstrated."
