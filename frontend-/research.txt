Case Analysis Reports

Below are detailed analysis reports for each of the three cases above. Each report discusses the proposed treatments, appropriate billing codes, and insurance-specific considerations (for Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, and Medi-Cal in California). The analyses include what a skilled physical therapist should consider in treating the condition and how to document and code the services to maximize reimbursement while adhering to the rules of each payer.

Case 1 Analysis: Right Shoulder Impingement Syndrome (Patient: John Doe, 45, Carpenter – Insurance: Aetna)

Condition & Treatment Overview: This patient has shoulder impingement syndrome due to repetitive overhead work. Key treatment elements include reducing inflammation, correcting biomechanical contributors (posture, strength imbalances), and restoring range of motion. The PT plan involves manual therapy for joint mobility and soft tissue extensibility, therapeutic exercises for rotator cuff and scapular stabilizer strengthening, stretches for tight posterior capsule/pectoral muscles, neuromuscular re-education for scapulohumeral rhythm, and patient education on posture and activity modification ￼ ￼. These interventions align with best practices for subacromial impingement: a combination of manual techniques, exercise, and functional training to alleviate impingement and prevent progression to rotator cuff tear ￼ ￼.

Recommended CPT Codes & Rationale:
	•	97140 (Manual Therapy, 15 min): Used for joint mobilizations (e.g. glenohumeral inferior or posterior glides to increase subacromial space) and soft tissue work on tight structures (such as cross-fiber massage to the subacromial region or pectoralis minor release). Manual therapy is appropriate as the patient has capsular tightness and trigger points contributing to impingement. Documentation should note the specific manual techniques applied and the region (e.g. “Grade III posterior glides to right GH joint to improve internal rotation”) ￼. All insurers cover 97140 for medically necessary cases. Aetna considers manual therapy a standard modality and would cover it as part of the treatment plan, noting that specialized manual techniques (e.g. MET or strain-counterstrain) are not separately reimbursed beyond 97140. Cigna covers 97140, but remember it counts toward the 4 units/session limit ￼. UHC covers manual therapy similarly; no special limits, but if multiple body regions are treated, still only one 97140 code per 15-min block is billed (the code already encompasses “one or more regions” per session) ￼. Medi-Cal will reimburse manual therapy if justified in the prescription and treatment plan (e.g. “joint mobilization to restore function”) – it must be part of the authorized services.
	•	97110 (Therapeutic Exercise, 15 min): For strengthening exercises targeting the rotator cuff (e.g. Theraband external rotations, scaption exercises) and stretching exercises to improve ROM. The documentation should detail the exercises, muscles targeted, and patient response (e.g. “Therapeutic exercises: performed 3×10 resistance band ER and IR for rotator cuff strengthening, 2×30 sec doorway stretch for pectoralis tightness”). These exercises improve strength and flexibility, directly addressing the impingement cause ￼. All insurers generally cover 97110 as a fundamental PT service. Cigna will allow up to four 97110 (or combination of active codes) per day ￼, so in a one-hour session one might bill 2-3 units of 97110 along with other codes. Aetna has no specific per-day unit cap but expects documentation of improvement; continued billing of 97110 is justified only if objective gains in strength/ROM are being made ￼. UHC covers it but may require functional improvement evidence. Medi-Cal covers therapeutic exercise if ordered by the referring provider – sessions must be justified in the Treatment Authorization Request including the exercise goals (e.g. increase shoulder AROM or strength to perform ADLs) ￼. Medi-Cal documentation should tie exercises to preventing disability (e.g. enabling patient to continue working, thus preventing significant disability, which meets Medi-Cal’s strict necessity definition) ￼.
	•	97112 (Neuromuscular Re-education, 15 min): This could be billed for training the patient in scapular stabilizing exercises and postural retraining. For example, teaching scapular retraction and depression exercises, proprioceptive exercises, or facilitating proper movement patterns for overhead reach (scapulohumeral rhythm drills) falls under 97112 because it’s improving coordination and posture ￼. Documentation example: “Neuromuscular re-ed: instructed and facilitated scapular setting exercises, dynamic stabilization in pain-free range to retrain scapula movement.” Insurers cover 97112 when there is a documented impairment in coordination or proprioception – in shoulder impingement, dyskinesia of the scapula qualifies. Aetna would cover this as part of skilled PT since improving posture and scapular control is medically necessary to treat the injury ￼. Cigna covers it, counting as one timed unit. Ensure the note distinguishes it from 97110 by emphasizing the balance/coordination aspect (e.g. “rhythmic stabilization” rather than just strength). UHC covers neuromuscular re-ed; UHC’s documentation guidelines (like Medicare’s) would require identifying the deficit (e.g. “scapular dyskinesia affecting functional reach”) and showing how training addresses it. Medi-Cal will reimburse 97112 if the need is clear (e.g. risk of loss of function without it); since Medi-Cal requires documentation that each service is necessary to “prevent significant disability” ￼, one could argue that without scapular retraining, the patient might not recover overhead function, impacting ability to work (significant disability).
	•	97530 (Therapeutic Activities, 15 min): This code can be used when incorporating simulated or real functional tasks, such as teaching the patient how to safely perform overhead lifting (e.g. lifting a weight overhead in a manner that minimizes impingement, or reaching into a cabinet). It involves dynamic functional movements to improve ability to perform work tasks ￼. In the plan, later sessions might include lifting a light toolbox overhead or practicing an overhead hammering motion with proper scapular control – that training is billed as 97530 because it’s task-oriented training to improve functional performance. Documentation: “Therapeutic activity: simulated overhead work task training for 15 min – patient practiced placing object on shelf using proper scapular engagement and core stability.” Insurers will cover 97530 if tied to functional goals (return-to-work tasks). Cigna includes 97530 in its covered codes, and like others, counts it toward timed units. Aetna and UHC cover it, but the therapist should avoid billing 97530 and 97110 for the exact same activity in the same session (to prevent perception of duplicate billing – differentiate therapeutic exercise vs. functional activity: e.g. ther-ex for isolated strength vs. ther-act for simulated ADL/work tasks). Medi-Cal will cover 97530 if it’s clearly part of restoring functional ability necessary for daily life or preventing hospitalization. For example, demonstrating that improving overhead reach allows patient to continue working safely could be seen as preventing “significant disability” (loss of job) which fits Medi-Cal’s necessity criteria ￼.
	•	97035 (Ultrasound, 15 min) or 97032 (Electrical Stimulation manual, 15 min) – if used: In this case, modalities are adjunctive. The plan mentioned possibly using ultrasound or interferential current (IFC) for pain if needed. Ultrasound (97035) is a constant attendance modality (requires one-on-one admin), billed per 15 min. It could be applied to the rotator cuff tendons for thermal effects to increase tissue extensibility before stretching. E-stim (97032) attended could be used for muscle re-ed or pain (though unattended e-stim is 97014/G0283 typically). If billing these, document the purpose: e.g. “Ultrasound 8 minutes to the subacromial region to reduce inflammation prior to exercise.” Some payers have ceased paying separately for certain modalities (considered low value). Aetna would generally cover ultrasound as part of standard PT (they haven’t listed ultrasound as non-covered – indeed Aetna’s CPB considers “augmented soft tissue mobilization” with tools as not extra billable but basic ultrasound is fine ￼). Cigna does cover ultrasound (97035 is in Cigna’s code list) but note Cigna’s stance: they don’t pay for modalities like infrared or vasopneumatic compression ￼, but ultrasound is not on the exclusion list. Still, Cigna and other payers expect that modalities are adjunct and the need should be justified (Cigna’s policy says modalities that are not preparatory to skilled treatment or not producing functional progress may be denied ￼). UHC would cover it if medically necessary, but some UHC plans might bundle modality payments or limit how many modalities can be billed in one session. Medi-Cal covers ultrasound and e-stim if they are in the prescription. Medi-Cal’s fee schedule lists HCPCS for modalities ￼, and they would need to be included in the authorized treatment. Because Medi-Cal focuses on necessity, one might need to justify that ultrasound is needed to alleviate severe pain (one of Medi-Cal’s criteria is alleviating severe pain) ￼ – this patient’s pain isn’t severe in general, so the PT might or might not include a lot of modality use depending on necessity.

Aetna Insurance Billing & Documentation Considerations:
	•	This patient's plan likely has a 60-day limit for PT per condition ￼. The PT plan is 6 weeks (~42 days) which fits under that. It's important to document that the patient is making measurable progress within this period; otherwise Aetna could deny further visits as not medically necessary ￼. In documentation, emphasize improvements in ROM, strength, and function every 2-4 weeks. Aetna will also expect to see a detailed initial plan of care signed by the PT and possibly the referring provider ￼ ￼ (some Aetna plans require physician approval of the PT plan within 30 days). The PT should also note that once goals are met or a plateau is reached, Aetna will not cover maintenance therapy ￼ – so if after 6 weeks the patient still has deficits but progress has stalled, Aetna may discontinue coverage. For coding, Aetna follows standard CPT coding rules (8-minute rule for timed codes, etc.). No specific modifiers are needed unless billing incident-to physician or multiple providers in one day (not in this scenario). The PT should avoid billing any services that Aetna considers investigational for shoulder pain – e.g. Aetna specifically mentions no proven benefit of kinesiotaping for shoulder problems ￼, so if the therapist uses therapeutic taping for posture, they probably shouldn't bill separately (taping might be considered part of 97112 or just not billed as there's no CPT for taping except an unlisted code, which Aetna would deny). Document all education and HEP instruction – while not separately billable, it supports the medical necessity of time spent.

Codes Utilization & Justifying Documentation: In summary, for each session the PT will likely bill a mix such as: 97140, 97110 (x2), 97112 (x1) – that's four units (or substitute 97530 for one of the 97110 on days focused on work simulation). This combination is both effective clinically and compliant with insurance limits. The documentation each visit should include:
	•	Objective measures of status (pain rating, ROM in degrees, etc.) to show ongoing need.
	•	Details of skilled intervention: e.g. "Joint mobilization grade III inferior glide to increase abduction – 10 minutes (97140)" – highlighting skill.
	•	Response to treatment: e.g. "after mobilization, shoulder abduction improved by 10° today" or "patient had less pain with impingement test post-treatment."
	•	Total treatment time (especially for Cigna and Medicare, but a good habit for all).
	•	Any patient education: posture, HEP reviewed (while not billable separately, it supports the therapeutic instruction aspect).

Aetna-specific notes: Aetna will likely not require prior authorization for initial visits but might for extended care if 60-day limit is approached – check plan. Also, all insurers (Aetna, Cigna, UHC) may subject claims to review if there are simultaneous chiropractic or other overlapping services. In shoulder impingement, that's less likely (if he was also seeing an ortho or chiro, ensure services are coordinated and not duplicated).

Maximizing Coverage within Rules: In this case, to maximize what can be done under Aetna insurance rules:
	•	Incorporate home exercises extensively – not billable, but improves outcomes faster so fewer visits are needed overall, staying within insurance limits.
	•	Avoid non-covered modalities (Aetna's investigational list) to not waste time on those.
	•	Keep the physician in loop. Aetna's policy requires a physician's involvement if using PT beyond standard (some plans might want physician sign-off on the PT POC).

Other Provider Demo Considerations:
	•	Cigna: If this patient had Cigna (for comparison), remember the 4-unit max rule ￼. A typical session might include 1 unit 97140, 2 units 97110, 1 unit 97112 (that's four units). If the PT tries to also do ultrasound in same visit, that would be a fifth unit (if performed as a constant attendance modality). In that case, Cigna's policy states they will not reimburse beyond 4 timed codes per day ￼. The clinic should prioritize which codes are most important. For example, on some visits the PT might omit a modality or combine therapeutic exercise and activities into fewer units to stay at 4 or under. Another Cigna consideration: they require documentation of total treatment time ￼. The therapist's note should clearly list the minutes spent on each code and total minutes. Also, ensure to include objective progress regularly; Cigna expects intermittent progress notes (they suggest at least every 10 visits) ￼. For shoulder impingement, progress could be measured in increased AROM, improved strength grades, and functional reports (e.g. patient can now lift X lbs overhead). Cigna also does not pay for "experimental" interventions: for instance, if the PT wanted to try laser therapy or dry needling for pain, those are explicitly non-covered by Cigna ￼. In this case, we didn't plan those, so we're aligned with covered services. Cigna typically doesn't require auth for a set number of visits but will deny if documentation is requested and goals weren't met/progress not shown. Use each allowed unit wisely (Cigna's 4-unit cap means use combination codes to address all deficits; e.g. use 97530 on a day when functional training is key, versus 97112 on a day focusing more on neuromuscular control). For instance, instead of taping (which Cigna won't pay for ￼), use exercises for scapular support. If PT does tape for proprioception, consider it part of 97112 (don't try to bill an unlisted code).
	•	UnitedHealthcare: UHC would cover these codes under the outpatient PT benefit as long as medical necessity is met. UHC often requires prior authorization or at least an initial evaluation submission especially for commercial plans. Let's assume for a commercial HMO/PPO plan, UHC might have delegated utilization review to Optum. Typically, an initial authorization might allow e.g. 6 visits to start. The PT must submit clinical notes demonstrating need for additional visits. Emphasize in documentation how pain and function are improving but not yet fully resolved, to justify continuation. Starting 2024, UHC Medicare Advantage definitely needs prior auth after eval ￼ ￼, but for a 45-year-old, it's likely a commercial plan. Some UHC plans also had an AT (Active Treatment) modifier requirement historically for Medicare-based claims, but that's more for Medicare. For commercial, ensure the diagnosis code used (e.g. M75.4) is on UHC's list of approved rehab diagnoses – shoulder impingement should be fine. UHC's documentation requests are similar to Medicare: note the functional progress, skilled care rationale, and continued need. One new change mentioned in a PT industry update: UHC Commercial no longer requires documenting in-and-out times for each session ￼, so just total minutes is okay. But the therapist should still record the time spent on each service to be audit-ready. UHC as noted often requires auth – failing to get it within 10 days of starting could forfeit reimbursement ￼. Thus, the clinic's admin should verify any auth requirements on day 1.
	•	Medi-Cal (California Medicaid): If the patient were covered by Medi-Cal, some distinct rules apply. Medi-Cal requires a written prescription/referral from a physician for PT services ￼, which would need to be on file and updated every 30 days or if the plan of care changes. We would ensure John's referring provider wrote a script that includes the diagnosis and "evaluate and treat shoulder" with frequency and duration. Also, all PT beyond the initial eval requires authorization (TAR) in Medi-Cal ￼. We would have to submit a Treatment Authorization Request explaining the plan (e.g. 18 visits over 6 weeks) and how this therapy is "immediately necessary to prevent significant disability" (since Medi-Cal defines medical necessity as services to prevent disability or alleviate severe pain) ￼. In John's case, preventing loss of his job (carpenter) due to a treatable shoulder condition could be framed as preventing significant disability (loss of livelihood/functional ability). The documentation for Medi-Cal must be meticulous: include the prescription, initial eval with measurable goals, and progress notes. Medi-Cal might only approve a certain number of visits at a time (commonly 6 or 12) and require re-authorization if more needed. We'd track outcomes like improved ROM or return to work tasks to justify any extension. Billing for Medi-Cal uses the same CPT codes, but note that Medi-Cal's reimbursement rates are often lower and some codes might be "bundled" or not separately reimbursed. For instance, Medi-Cal might not separately pay for hot/cold packs (97010 is usually bundled everywhere, and Medi-Cal likely doesn't pay for it as a separate code). We should focus on active codes that demonstrate skill. Also, if John were older with Medicare plus Medi-Cal, then Medicare's rules (8 min rule, G-codes if still required, etc.) would come first, and Medi-Cal would be secondary payer. For Medi-Cal, absolutely need the physician prescription on file ￼.

By adhering to these guidelines, the PT ensures the patient receives comprehensive care for shoulder impingement, and the clinic receives proper reimbursement without denials. The outcome goal is that John returns to full duty work, which will signify to the insurer that therapy was successful and ended when appropriate (avoiding unnecessary extended treatment).

Case 2 Analysis: Left Knee Medial Meniscus Tear (Conservative Management) (Patient: Emily Smith, 17, Soccer player – Insurance: Cigna)

Condition & Treatment Overview: This is a young athlete with a medial meniscus tear being treated non-surgically. PT aims to reduce pain and swelling, restore knee range of motion, strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding musculature, and improve stability to prevent knee giving-way. The treatment plan includes pain control with ice/compression (especially early), manual therapy for joint mobility (e.g. patellar mobilizations, soft tissue work), progressive therapeutic exercises for strength (quads, hamstrings, hips) and range (gradual knee flexion/extension improvement), neuromuscular re-education for dynamic knee stability and balance, and functional/sport-specific training when appropriate ￼ ￼. The approach aligns with standard care for meniscus injuries, emphasizing quad strengthening and proprioceptive training to compensate for meniscal injury and protect the knee ￼ ￼.

Because Cigna is the insurer, special attention must be given to their coverage policy and documentation rules:
	•	Keep each visit’s billed timed codes to 4 or fewer ￼.
	•	Avoid any modalities or services Cigna doesn’t cover (they won’t pay for infrared, H-Wave, taping, etc., but those are not central to meniscus rehab anyway) ￼.
	•	Document total minutes of treatment and ensure that exercises and functional gains are well-documented, since Cigna expects to see that in notes ￼.

Recommended CPT Codes & Rationale:
	•	97110 (Therapeutic Exercise): This will be heavily used for knee rehab. It covers open and closed chain exercises to improve strength and ROM. For Emily, examples include quad sets, straight-leg raises, mini-squats, leg presses, hamstring curls, etc., performed with proper form. Also, gentle ROM exercises (heel slides, stationary bike with no resistance) can count as therapeutic exercise aimed at improving joint mobility. Documentation might say: “97110 x 2 units – exercises included: left quads strengthening (leg press 0-45° arc, 3×10) and hamstring curls (3×10 light theraband), hip abductor strengthening with bands (3×12), and active range drills to 130° flexion.” All these are aimed at improving knee stability and motion. Cigna will reimburse 97110, but we must consider that multiple units will use up the session’s quota of 4 timed codes. Likely 2 units of 97110 each session, combined with other codes, is reasonable. We must show objective improvements in strength over time (e.g. quad strength from 4-/5 to 4+/5 after a few weeks) to justify continuing 97110 each visit ￼.
	•	Under Aetna or UHC (for comparison), there’s no strict 4-unit cap, but they similarly expect progress. In a youth athlete, progress should be evident (e.g. increased single-leg squat ability, etc.).
	•	Under Medi-Cal (if applicable), 97110 is covered if medically necessary – since she’s 17, she might not be Medi-Cal except if low-income or secondary. But just to note, Medi-Cal would require the physician’s prescription detailing exercises to increase strength/prevent surgery, aligning with necessity to prevent more invasive measures.
	•	97112 (Neuromuscular Re-education): Key for balance and proprioception exercises and any gait training. For Emily, after initial pain subsides, therapy will involve neuromuscular training like single-leg balance on various surfaces, perturbation training, or using a wobble board – all to improve knee joint stability and proprioceptive feedback, which are crucial after a meniscus injury (meniscus contributes to joint stability and proprioception, so its injury necessitates training those aspects). Also, NMES (neuromuscular electrical stimulation) to the quads can fall under 97112 if the therapist is actively facilitating muscle contraction and retraining (though if the e-stim is done without active patient participation, it might be billed as unattended e-stim 97014; but one-on-one NMES training where patient contracts with stimulation can be part of 97112). Documentation example: “97112 – Neuromuscular re-ed: performed single-leg stance drills on foam for 15 min to improve proprioception and knee stability; incorporated perturbations and feedback to correct dynamic valgus. Also used brief NMES on VMO during quad activation exercises to improve muscle recruitment.” Cigna covers 97112 within the 4-unit rule; typically one unit per session might be used for balance training. This code differentiates the balance/proprioceptive aspect from pure strengthening. We should document the specific deficit (e.g. poor balance, dynamic valgus) and how training addressed it. Aetna and UHC also cover 97112 for balance or coordination deficits – for a knee case, it’s clearly warranted since she has “giving way” and needs neuromuscular training. Medi-Cal would cover if ordered; likely yes if phrased as “gait/balance training to prevent injury”.
	•	97530 (Therapeutic Activities): This could be used especially in later rehab when doing more functional or sport-simulated tasks. For example, once she can do more, the PT might do ladder drills, lateral movements, or simulated pivoting drills to train return-to-sport activities. These are dynamic, multi-planar activities aimed at functional improvement (soccer-specific movements), so 97530 is appropriate ￼. Early on, therapeutic activities might include step-down training or sit-to-stand practice (which are functional activities) – these too could be billed as 97530. The documentation should tie the activity to function: “97530 – functional training: practiced stepping down from an 8” step with proper knee alignment for improved safety on stairs; coached athletic cutting maneuver at slow speed to simulate soccer movement, focusing on knee control.” Because Emily is eager to return to sports, integrating such tasks not only helps her physically but also psychologically (confidence in her knee). Insurers will pay for 97530 as long as it’s distinct from ther-ex; we should not bill 97530 for something like a basic exercise that could be 97110 – it should involve a functional, task-oriented element. For Cigna, again, it counts toward the 4 units. Possibly one unit of 97530 per session when appropriate. Aetna/UHC: no special restrictions beyond medical necessity; they expect to see functional goals tied to it. Medi-Cal: would cover if the prescription or TAR mentions training in functional activities (like stairs, etc., to prevent disability).
	•	97010 (Hot/Cold Pack): While not typically separately reimbursed by Medicare or some insurers, Cigna’s code list includes 97010 for hot/cold packs ￼. However, many private payers follow Medicare’s lead and consider 97010 bundled (included in other services). Given Cigna’s stance that modalities not leading to significant progress are not covered ￼, it’s safest to assume they don’t separately pay for a mere ice pack. We will use cryotherapy (ice) for her knee, but as part of treatment, and likely not attempt to bill 97010, or if we do, expect no separate reimbursement. If we did bill it, it’s an untimed code. Cigna’s policy specifically flags vasopneumatic compression (97016) as not covered ￼ ￼, but using a simple compression wrap is just part of treatment, not a billable service. So, include ice/compression in notes for completeness (“applied ice and compression for 15 minutes post-exercise to control swelling”), but focus billing on skilled codes.
	•	97032 (Attended E-stim) or G0283 (Unattended E-stim): If using electrical stimulation for her quads (to address quad inhibition), one could bill 97032 for attended e-stim (since you might be doing it in conjunction with exercise – e.g. Russian stim with quad sets, which is attended). If we instead set up a TENS or IFC for pain and let her rest with it, that’s unattended, billed as G0283 (Medicare code for unattended e-stim; Cigna might accept 97014 as the CPT equivalent). However, Cigna’s not explicit about denying e-stim; they do deny H-Wave specifically (which is a proprietary e-stim) ￼, but standard e-stim is allowed. Still, to maximize her functional outcomes, e-stim should be adjunct. If we bill it, it uses up one of the 4 slots (if attended 97032). Possibly better to incorporate NMES into ther-ex or neuromuscular re-ed time (as part of the exercise, not separate billing) to save a billing slot. The PT may choose not to bill separate e-stim to stay within 4 units of more important services. In documentation, they can mention NMES used during exercise without billing it separately.

Cigna Documentation Focus:
	•	We must demonstrate objective improvements at regular intervals. For a young athlete, we might re-test her single-leg balance time, hop tests (when she’s able), knee ROM, swelling (girth), and report progress. For example, after 4 weeks: knee flexion improved to 140°, quad strength to 5/5, balance to 20 sec, etc. If progress is good, continue; if plateau or instability remains, the doctor might consider surgery. Document that therapy is helping avoid surgery (Cigna will be happy to cover PT if it potentially saves a surgical expense).
	•	Document patient compliance and home program education. Cigna wants to see that we’re not just doing passive stuff; they expect active patient participation (which we have).
	•	Ensure the initial evaluation and plan included short-term and long-term goals, per Cigna’s requirements ￼. Our intake form did that (goals of full ROM, return to sport, etc.).
	•	Progress reports: The policy said “intermittent progress reports required” ￼. Cigna doesn’t specify, but a safe bet is at least every 4 weeks or 10 visits. For Emily, maybe after 4 weeks we’ll do one. If her plan covers unlimited visits up to some limit, we might not hit a hard cap because she’s likely to be done in 8-10 weeks (~16 visits). Still, we should produce a progress note at mid-point to show improvement.
	•	Total treatment time: For each visit note, list the minutes per code and sum. E.g. “Ther ex: 30 min (97110 x2), Neuromuscular re-ed: 15 min (97112 x1), Therapeutic activities: 15 min (97530 x1). Total timed minutes = 60.” That way, any reviewer sees we adhered to the 4-unit/60-minute guideline and properly used the 8-minute rule (Cigna follows AMA CPT time rules, likely similar to Medicare).

Insurance Authorization Considerations:
	•	Cigna typically does not require prior authorization for a set number of PT visits for minors on many plans, but some plans use third-party reviewers (like ASH – American Specialty Health – which Cigna often uses for PT). In some cases, Cigna/ASH require the therapist to submit the initial eval and get visits authorized beyond an initial allotment. If ASH is involved, they may initially allow e.g. 6 visits, then require a progress note to approve more. The therapist should be prepared to submit objective data to justify additional visits. Because Emily is showing improvement and aiming to return to sport, that is a strong justification to continue therapy beyond just pain relief (restoring high-level function).
	•	If her plan had a hard visit limit (some employer plans might say e.g. 20 PT visits/year), we’d plan carefully. For example, if she had a limit of 20 and might need all for full rehab, ensure not to waste any on things she could do independently. We would front-load education and home program so that near discharge she can continue on her own.
	•	If Cigna requires the use of certain billing modifiers (like GP for PT services – though GP is Medicare, some insurers also adopt it), ensure to append them. Typically, GP modifier indicates a service delivered by a PT. Cigna might not require it, but UnitedHealthcare often does on Medicare Advantage claims.

Maximizing Coverage (Creative Compliance): The question asks for getting creative to maximize coverage within rules. For Emily’s case under Cigna:
	•	We will use the full 4 units each session to get as much therapy in as possible. For example, a typical session might use: 2 units 97110 (strengthening), 1 unit 97112 (balance/NMES), 1 unit 97530 (functional drill). This hits the 4-unit cap ￼ and ensures each aspect of rehab is addressed. If we only did 3 units, we’d be under-utilizing what Cigna allows.
	•	We can alternate codes across sessions to cover all needs. On days where we emphasize range of motion or manual work more, we might do 1 unit 97140 (if knee joint mobilization needed to get extension, or patella mob – though some might not bill 97140 for a simple patella mob, but one could if it’s a skilled technique taking time), 1-2 units 97110, 1 unit 97112, etc. We just ensure never to exceed 4.
	•	Cigna doesn’t reimburse work hardening (97545/97546) ￼ which is more for multi-hour sessions; not applicable here. But if we wanted to maximize within rules, we keep sessions around 60 minutes of billable time which is typical.
	•	Another creative approach: Group therapy (97150) is covered by Cigna (in their code list) ￼, but that’s only useful if treating multiple patients at once. Not relevant here since she likely has one-on-one. But theoretically, if there were multiple athletes in a session doing similar exercises, group therapy code could be used in addition to one-on-one codes to extend total treatment time. However, group therapy pays less and is not commonly done in outpatient ortho for insurance reimbursement purposes – likely not applicable.
	•	Home program and sports clinic: Perhaps encourage family to utilize any school athletic trainer services in addition to PT. From an insurance perspective, that doesn’t affect billing, but it maximizes her care without extra insurance cost.

Other Provider Demo Considerations:
	•	Aetna: If Emily had Aetna instead, Aetna often allows more flexibility in units per visit (no strict 4-unit rule), but they might limit total days (say 60 days or a certain number of visits). The PT would ensure to document that this isn't just sports performance (which Aetna excludes if it's solely to improve athletic ability beyond normal function) ￼. We frame it as restoring normal function after injury, not enhancing beyond baseline. Aetna would be okay as long as we aim to get her back to pre-injury status (which is normal for her age). Aetna also doesn't cover formal "maintenance" or long-term conditioning; once she's back to sport, therapy should stop. They would not cover ongoing training to improve, say, vertical jump or agility beyond what was lost – that becomes performance training, not rehab.
	•	UnitedHealthcare: If she had UHC, typically no 4 unit limit, but UHC might require prior auth as well for a teen on parents' plan. Many UHC plans (especially HMO) use Optum which might allow an initial 6-8 visits, then require medical review. Since she's young and otherwise healthy, UHC will expect she can recover quickly. The PT should be careful not to over-utilize visits without clear need, or UHC might deny further visits as not medically necessary if she's already functional.
	•	Medi-Cal (California Medicaid): If she were Medi-Cal (maybe if income eligible or secondary), Medi-Cal tends to approve therapy if it's going to avoid surgery (which is costly). The PT could emphasize that therapy is needed to prevent knee surgery – Medi-Cal likes cost-saving measures. However, Medi-Cal might question frequency for a 17-year-old unless it's truly necessary; they might think she could heal with just a home program if not fully understanding the sports demands. Good documentation and MD support would help. Also note, at 17, if she were covered under the EPSDT (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment) mandate, Medicaid must cover all services that are medically necessary for children/teens, even beyond typical limits. So Medi-Cal would actually be required to cover her PT as needed to "correct or ameliorate" her knee condition. That means if therapy will restore her knee and prevent future issues, EPSDT could allow more visits than normally allowed for adults. The PT would reference EPSDT if hitting any barriers ("Under EPSDT, continued PT is warranted for this 17-year-old to regain full function and avoid long-term disability.").

Documentation to Satisfy Codes:
For each billed code, ensure the documentation aligns:
	•	97110: note repetitions, sets, resistance, muscle group – show skilled progression (e.g. increased weight, changed angle).
	•	97112: note balance challenges, cues given, coordination tasks – just saying “balance exercises” is not enough; say “balance training on BOSU with manual perturbations, needed tactile cueing to activate gluteus medius and maintain knee alignment.”
	•	97530: note functional task and why – e.g. “practiced pivoting to simulate soccer cut, to improve ability to return to sport without reinjury.”
	•	If any manual therapy (97140) was done, document e.g. “joint mobilization to tibiofemoral joint to increase extension – 10 minutes” or “deep tissue massage to IT band for lateral knee pain relief – 5 minutes” (though deep tissue for ITB could also be part of manual).
	•	Modalities if billed (say we did bill 97032 for NMES): must document parameters (e.g. “NMES to VMO, 10 minutes, 50Hz, on:off 10:50 for muscle re-ed during quad sets – patient tolerated, got visible contraction.”). This shows skilled use rather than just a passive modality.

Given our plan, likely we won’t separately bill modalities, focusing on the active codes to maximize value of each visit.

Outcome and Billing Finish: We anticipate about 16 visits over 8 weeks. Cigna will expect a discharge summary at the end ￼. In that, we document that she achieved >90% of her goals, e.g. returned to soccer practice, and outline any remaining deficits or home program instructions.

As a final check: ensure no billing for non-covered items (Cigna’s list: we haven’t included any of those like dry needling or taping as separate – if we tape her knee for stability, that’s part of session but not billed). Also, be mindful of timed code rounding: Cigna follows standard 8-minute rule (although Cigna policy doesn’t state explicitly, it references AMA guidelines ￼). So we need at least 8 minutes to bill a unit. We’ll structure therapy so each billed unit hits that threshold.

By navigating Cigna’s rules and focusing on skilled, necessary interventions, the PT can maximize the authorized coverage for Emily’s knee rehab and get her safely back to sport.

Case 3 Analysis: Chronic Low Back Pain with Functional Decline (Patient: Maria Garcia, 60 – Insurance: Medi-Cal (Medicaid) in California, with possible Medicare)

Condition & Treatment Overview: Maria has chronic low back pain (LBP) with deconditioning and balance issues. Treatment needs to address pain management, improve core and lower extremity strength, increase flexibility, and enhance balance and mobility for fall prevention. The plan includes modalities for pain relief (heat, TENS), a graded exercise program focusing on core stabilization and lower-body strengthening, stretching of tight muscles (hip flexors, hamstrings), aquatic therapy to enable low-impact exercise, balance and gait training, and extensive patient education in body mechanics and home exercises ￼ ￼. The goal is to improve her ability to perform daily activities and prevent disability (e.g. avoid falls or hospitalization).

Because she is on Medi-Cal (Medicaid) in California, and possibly Medicare (if disabled or age 65, though she’s 60 so just Medi-Cal here), special rules and documentation are in play:
	•	Physician Prescription and Prior Authorization: Medi-Cal requires a doctor’s prescription for PT, and authorization for all visits including initial eval ￼. We must clearly justify in the Treatment Authorization Request (TAR) how PT will prevent a “significant disability” or “alleviate severe pain,” per Medi-Cal’s medical necessity definition ￼.
	•	Visit Limits: California Medi-Cal doesn’t have a hard visit cap per year, but each request is reviewed. Typically, initial auth might be for e.g. 6 or 12 visits. We requested 24 visits in the plan (2x/week * 12 wks). Medi-Cal will likely approve a smaller chunk first, wanting proof of improvement for more. We will need to send progress notes to justify continuing beyond the first authorization period.
	•	Documentation for Medi-Cal: Emphasize objective gains and tie them to function. For example, “patient’s Timed Up & Go improved from 16s to 12s, reducing fall risk” or “can now stand 20 minutes vs 10 before” shows progress that justifies ongoing therapy.

Recommended CPT Codes & Rationale:
	•	97110 (Therapeutic Exercise): Core strengthening and lower extremity strengthening exercises are billed here. For Maria, exercises include pelvic tilts, partial crunches or isometric core exercises, bridging, hip strengthening (e.g. clamshells, side-lying leg raises), and general conditioning exercises (maybe light resistance training for legs). Also, gentle stretching (hamstring, lumbar rotation stretches) fall under therapeutic exercise aimed at improving range of motion. Document: “97110 – Therapeutic exercise: performed 20 min of core stabilization exercises (supine pelvic tilts, bridges 3×10) and lower extremity strengthening (sit-to-stand practice 3×5, theraband side steps 2×15) to improve back support and functional mobility.” All insurers including Medi-Cal cover 97110 for strengthening and flexibility. Medicare (if she had it) would cover it as well, under the 8-minute rule.
	•	Since Medi-Cal is primary here, note that Medi-Cal pays per code according to a fee schedule ￼. We must ensure not to bill anything not on their list or above allowed units. Medi-Cal likely follows Medicare 8-min rule too for timed codes. We’ll use maybe 2-3 units of 97110 per session because a lot of her session is exercise-based.
	•	For Medi-Cal justification: each exercise should be connected to functional improvement (e.g. “improve ability to rise from chair, ambulate safely, etc.”). This shows it’s not just general fitness (which Medi-Cal wouldn’t cover), but specifically to address her impairments from her medical condition.
	•	97112 (Neuromuscular Re-education): This code will cover her balance training, gait training, and any proprioceptive exercises. Maria has impaired balance (Romberg mildly positive, unsteady gait), so we will spend time on activities like tandem walking, single-leg stance practice (with support initially), turning and navigating obstacles, etc. Also, training her in proper gait with a cane, improving posture while walking, falls prevention strategies – these fall under neuromuscular re-ed (some could also be 97530 if framed as functional mobility, but typically gait/balance can be 97112 or even 97116 for gait training; we should consider 97116 (Gait Training) as well). Actually, let’s differentiate:
	•	97116 (Gait Training, 15 min): Specifically for gait training exercises – Medicare and others often expect you to use 97116 if you’re focusing on ambulation technique (instead of 97112). In Maria’s case, we are indeed training gait (with cane, etc.) and stair navigation. We could bill 97116 for that portion. 97116 documentation: “Gait training: practiced walking with improved posture and reciprocal arm swing for 10 minutes; instructed in use of single-point cane on right side, training proper sequencing. Practiced stepping over threshold and ascending 4 stairs with railing.”
	•	97112 would cover static/dynamic balance training that isn’t strictly gait – e.g. balance board, foam exercises, coordination drills. For billing, we might use one or the other per session or even both if distinct time is spent (but careful not to double-dip for similar tasks).
	•	Medi-Cal covers gait training (they have code 97116 allowed) – but we’d need to justify it as necessary to prevent falls (which is valid).
	•	Many Medicaid plans and Medicare too require that for gait training or neuromuscular re-ed, the patient has an impairment in gait/balance (which she does). Document measurable improvements (e.g. TUG time, ability to do tandem walk) over time to show effectiveness.
	•	If Maria had Medicare, Medicare would cover 97112 and 97116 as long as documentation supports it (the new Medicare rules require demonstrating complexity in eval code, but that’s separate). If she had both Medicare and Medi-Cal (dual eligible), Medicare would be primary and require the G-codes (functional reporting) if it was 2025 – actually G-codes were discontinued in 2019 for Medicare, so just ignore that; but Medicare would track her therapy dollar usage against the threshold (in 2025, threshold might be around $2120 for PT/SLP combined), and Medi-Cal would pick up copays. We’d have to ensure we use KX modifier when exceeding threshold for Medicare (indicating services are medically necessary beyond soft cap). That’s a nuance if she were dual-eligible.
	•	In any case, neuromuscular re-ed and/or gait training will be significant parts of her therapy – likely 1-2 units per session combined. We might do, for example, 1 unit 97112 for balance and 1 unit 97116 for gait on some days.
	•	97530 (Therapeutic Activities): For functional training like sit-to-stand transfers, lifting mechanics, and any simulated ADLs. Maria needs training in proper body mechanics for bending and lifting (to protect her back) and functional strengthening through activities (like practicing getting in and out of a chair or tub safely). That training can be billed as 97530 since it’s directly tied to functional performance ￼. Another example: if we set up a scenario to practice picking up objects from the floor correctly, that’s a dynamic activity improving functional performance (lifting technique). Documentation: “97530 – Therapeutic activity: instructed patient in safe lifting technique with a 10-lb box, practicing proper squat and spine alignment (15 min). Also practiced getting in/out of low chair and car with pain-free strategies.” This shows functional application of her improved strength and flexibility. Medi-Cal would cover this if justified as necessary training for ADLs (which it is, to prevent injury and hospital visits due to falls or back strain).
	•	For Medicare, 97530 is covered but they often audit that vs 97110 to ensure not billing both for same exercise. The rule of thumb is: 97110 for impairments, 97530 for functional tasks. We have clear functional tasks here, so we’re fine.
	•	We will likely use 97530 one unit in sessions where we specifically do these tasks. If a session is more focused on exercises and balance, maybe not every session uses 97530, but at least weekly we’d incorporate functional training.
	•	97140 (Manual Therapy): We plan on manual therapy like joint mobilizations (e.g. lumbar PA glides or hip mobilizations) and soft tissue massage (for muscle spasm in low back, or myofascial release for paraspinals). Billing 97140 is appropriate if we spend time on it. For example, doing 10 minutes of lumbar soft tissue mobilization and some PA mobilizations to lumbar facets could be billed as one unit 97140. Documentation: “97140 – Manual therapy: performed grade I-II lumbar mobilizations to L4-5 for pain relief, and soft tissue mobilization to bilateral lumbar paraspinals and QL to reduce muscle guarding (15 min).”
	•	Medi-Cal will reimburse manual therapy as part of the treatment if it’s in the plan (the physician’s Rx could mention “mobilization as needed”).
	•	This can help alleviate her pain, which Medi-Cal likes because one of their necessity criteria is “alleviate severe pain” ￼. If her pain is moderate (5-7/10), we can argue therapy keeps it from being severe or becoming severe.
	•	If she had Medicare, manual therapy is fine; just not to mix it up with chiropractic manipulation (different code). A PT doing non-spinal manipulations or grade V could still use 97140 since PTs can’t bill chiropractic codes.
	•	**97036 (Hubbard tank/hydrotherapy) or 97113 (Aquatic Therapy, 15 min): We included aquatic therapy once weekly. The CPT code for aquatic therapy with therapeutic exercises is 97113 ￼. This is a time-based code. In aquatic sessions, we’d be doing essentially therapeutic exercise but in water, which justifies using the specific aquatic therapy code. Documentation: “97113 – Aquatic therapy: in therapy pool, patient performed 30 minutes of exercises including water walking, gentle squats, and flotation-assisted active range for trunk and hips. Focus on reducing gravitational load to allow movement with less pain, improve tolerance for upright activity.”
	•	Insurers vary on aquatic therapy coverage. Aetna often covers it if standard therapy on land is not tolerated; Cigna lists 97113 as covered when criteria met ￼; UHC covers if medically necessary. Medi-Cal would cover aquatic therapy if the provider has it available and the need is justified – usually, one has to explain why land therapy is insufficient. For example, with her obesity and pain, aquatic allows exercise she couldn’t do on land. That fits a necessity argument. However, not all PT providers offer aquatic therapy, and some Medicaid plans might not have a facility. If our clinic has a pool, we can do it. We need to include aquatic therapy in the TAR as a modality to be used. Medi-Cal might want to know frequency and expected outcome from aquatic therapy.
	•	If the aquatic therapy is provided at a different facility or by a hospital, coordination is needed. But assuming we handle it, we bill 97113 for the time in pool.
	•	We must still stay within total authorized visits; if one of her weekly sessions is in the pool, that counts as one visit.
	•	Monitor that aquatic therapy is not something Cigna listed as non-covered; it’s not on their exclusion list, so Cigna’s fine with it. Aetna either. UHC often covers it if needed but sometimes requires prior auth with justification. For Medi-Cal, again, justification is key: “Aquatic therapy is necessary to allow patient to exercise with reduced pain, aiming to improve her mobility to prevent future hospitalization due to falls or immobility.”
	•	97010 (Hot/Cold packs) and 97014/G0283 (unattended e-stim for pain): We plan to use a hot pack at session start and possibly TENS for pain at end. These modalities are typically not separately paid by Medicare or Medi-Cal (Medi-Cal’s manual might bundle them). Medi-Cal’s fee schedule lists codes and max rates ￼, but hot pack is usually considered inclusive. We might still apply them as part of treatment but not count on extra reimbursement. If needed, we could bill G0283 for TENS if time permits, but likely focus on active therapy codes since Medi-Cal rates are low and they want skilled care evidence.
	•	Documenting modalities is still important to show comprehensive pain management: e.g. “Moist heat x 10 min to lumbar area for muscle relaxation prior to exercise” (no CPT code billed), “TENS applied x 15 min for analgesia post-therapy” (could bill G0283 if standalone, but if she’s doing it concurrently with something or just at end, might not bother billing).
	•	If she had Medicare primary, note that Medicare would not pay for hot/cold separate (bundled). They pay for unattended e-stim G0283 only in certain circumstances (often it’s also bundled into eval unless done as separate treatment for pain).
	•	We mainly include these to ensure she’s comfortable enough to participate in therapy (which indirectly supports medical necessity by allowing more active work).

Medi-Cal Specific Documentation & Authorization:
	•	We need to fill out the Treatment Authorization Request (TAR) form with:
	•	Diagnosis (ICD-10 codes for her: e.g. M47.816 – spondylosis, maybe M62.3 for muscle weakness, R26.81 for unsteadiness on feet).
	•	Objective findings (ROM, TUG time, etc.), functional limitations (can’t walk >10 min, etc.), and why PT is needed (to prevent falls/injury, avoid decline).
	•	Planned treatment with frequency/duration and each intervention (so include aquatic therapy if used, otherwise it might not be covered).
	•	Physician’s prescription attached.
	•	Since her case is chronic, Medi-Cal might question ongoing therapy. Emphasize in TAR that her recent functional decline (increased pain, almost fell) indicates a need for skilled intervention now, to prevent likely hospitalization (e.g. from a fall or from pain exacerbation).
	•	Medi-Cal’s manual states authorization is limited to services necessary to prevent hospitalization or disability or continue recovery from hospitalization ￼. We will say PT is aimed at preventing anticipated hospitalization by improving her balance and managing her pain (thus preventing a fall or need for more invasive pain treatment).
	•	Also, mention any prior treatments: if she’s had none recently, that works in our favor (clearly there’s no duplication).
	•	Progress Reports for Medi-Cal: Typically, when asking for more visits, we submit progress to show improvement. For example, after 12 visits, we might submit an extension request with updated metrics: “pain reduced to 3/10, TUG now 12s, patient can walk 15 min vs 5 min prior.” That justifies the remaining 12 visits of plan.



Maximizing Coverage & Creative Strategies:
This scenario is about expanding treatments provided to maximize coverage:
	•	We have indeed included a broad array of services: therapeutic exercise, activities, neuromuscular re-ed, gait training, aquatic therapy, manual therapy, modalities. This ensures we address all her needs and also allows billing multiple codes (while all justified). For example, a single land session for Maria could legitimately include: heat (no bill), manual therapy (97140, 1 unit), ther-ex (97110, 2 units), gait training (97116, 1 unit), TENS (no bill or G0283 small). That's 4 units plus some freebies (heat). On aquatic day, we might bill 97113 (aquatic) for, say, 2 units (30 min) plus some land-based ther-ex or balance when out of pool for 1-2 units if done (or entire session in pool for 45 min = 3 units of 97113, and maybe some land stretch after). Medi-Cal would see we're providing skilled care across multiple domains.
	•	We are careful not to include any non-covered experimental stuff. For chronic LBP, some may try things like laser, inversion tables, etc. Medi-Cal likely wouldn't cover those unless under another code. We stick to well-accepted treatments.
	•	Group Therapy: not really applicable, she's one-on-one.
	•	Telehealth: California Medicaid does pay for telehealth PT visits (especially since COVID). If she had trouble coming in, we could convert some visits to telehealth and still bill (likely still 97110 etc with 95 modifier for telehealth). But since we have aquatic in clinic and she can come, we prefer in-person for safety. It's an option if needed to maximize consistency of care.
	•	Home Program and Community resources: While not billable, connecting her with community exercise classes for seniors (after PT) could maintain gains without cost to insurer. Document that we educated her on a long-term fitness plan – shows proactive discharge planning (insurers appreciate that as it reduces relapse).
	•	Because Medi-Cal's reimbursement is low, some clinics restrict how many Medi-Cal patients or visits they do (financial reality). But since the task is maximizing coverage, we assume we will treat fully but efficiently.

Ensuring Compliance and Avoiding Denials:
	•	With Medicaid, audit risk is significant. We must ensure session notes match billing exactly. E.g., if we bill 97116 gait training, the note must explicitly describe gait training – Medicaid auditors will deny if they don’t see it in writing. Same for aquatic 97113 – note should clearly describe water-based therapy.
	•	Time tracking: If one session includes both 97116 and 97112, make sure each had distinct time (don’t double-count any minute). Possibly we do 15 min gait (97116) + 15 min balance (97112) and document separately.
	•	Attendance: If she misses visits, document attempts to reschedule – Medi-Cal sometimes denies payment if frequency is not as prescribed (they think patient non-compliant = maybe therapy not needed). So keep compliance high or update plan if frequency changes.
	•	Outcome measurement: Using something like Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) or similar could strengthen documentation to show improvement in perceived disability. Not required by insurer but helpful if we had to appeal for more visits.

Conclusion of Care & Billing:
As therapy progresses, we measure success by functional gains: if by 12 weeks she achieves walking 30 minutes and has reduced pain, we’d likely discharge or move her to a self-maintenance program (since chronic cases shouldn’t go on indefinitely in PT per insurance eyes). Medi-Cal would not pay for maintenance care, so once goals are met or a plateau is reached, we must discharge. If she still has moderate deficits but is much better, we might attempt a final TAR extension if justified, but usually after a certain point Medi-Cal expects a break in therapy to see if gains hold.

We would produce a discharge summary highlighting objective improvements (e.g. TUG from 16 -> 10 seconds; Berg Balance score improved; Oswestry score improved by X%; lumbar flexion increased; pain down to 2/10; etc.). We’d state she can now function independently with a home program. This documentation closes the case properly, which is important especially if she ever needs to re-initiate therapy (then we can show prior outcomes).

By adhering to California's Medicaid rules and thoroughly documenting medical necessity and progress, we ensure that Maria receives the full course of therapy she needs and that it is reimbursed. The detailed attention to state-specific requirements (prescription, TARs, etc.) prevents administrative denials. The end result should be improved quality of life for Maria (being more independent and safe) and satisfaction of Medi-Cal's goal of preventing more costly healthcare interventions (like emergency care from a fall or back surgery).

Other Provider Demo Considerations:
	•	Medicare: While she's 60 (not Medicare age), if she eventually transitions to Medicare or if she had disability Medicare, we'd ensure we comply with Medicare's documentation: initial eval with proper evaluation CPT code (97161/97162/97163 depending on complexity – likely moderate or high complexity given multiple comorbidities), treatment notes, and functional outcome tracking. Medicare's threshold and potential targeted review: we would use KX modifier when cost exceeds threshold, indicating services are reasonable and necessary. Given 24 visits, that might approach threshold but not hugely exceed. Also, new Medicare rules emphasize value-based care; showing that therapy improved function is crucial to avoid denial as not medically necessary. If she had both Medicare and Medi-Cal (dual eligible), Medicare would be primary and Medi-Cal would pick up copays. We'd have to ensure we use KX modifier when exceeding threshold for Medicare (indicating services are medically necessary beyond soft cap). If she had Medicare primary, note that Medicare would not pay for hot/cold separate (bundled). They pay for unattended e-stim G0283 only in certain circumstances (often it's also bundled into eval unless done as separate treatment for pain). For Medicare, 97530 is covered but they often audit that vs 97110 to ensure not billing both for same exercise. The rule of thumb is: 97110 for impairments, 97530 for functional tasks. Many Medicaid plans and Medicare too require that for gait training or neuromuscular re-ed, the patient has an impairment in gait/balance (which she does). Document measurable improvements (e.g. TUG time, ability to do tandem walk) over time to show effectiveness.
	•	Aetna: Under Aetna, would generally cover these services but may have visit limits (e.g., 60-day limit). Aetna also doesn't cover some experimental treatments for chronic LBP that they consider unproven. Would need to focus on well-accepted treatments and document progress regularly.
	•	Cigna: With Cigna, would need to stay within 4-unit per session limit. Cigna lists 97113 (aquatic therapy) as covered when criteria met. Insurers vary on aquatic therapy coverage – Cigna's fine with it when justified. They don't cover some experimental treatments either.
	•	UnitedHealthcare: UHC would cover these services if medically necessary. Often requires prior authorization. UHC covers aquatic therapy if medically necessary but sometimes requires prior auth with justification.
