Reference Document: Aetna Physical Therapy Policy (Clinical Policy Bulletin)

Medical Necessity Criteria: Aetna considers physical therapy (PT) medically necessary only when specific criteria are met. The patient’s healthcare provider must determine there is a reasonable expectation that the condition will significantly improve within a predictable timeframe (typically within one month of starting therapy), or that PT is needed to establish a safe and effective maintenance program ￼ ￼. PT services should be provided according to a written plan of care that demonstrates medical necessity and includes the diagnosis, treatment techniques, frequency/duration, and measurable goals ￼ ￼. PT must be performed by a licensed therapist (or under appropriate supervision) and require the skills of a therapist (i.e. not something the patient could do independently) ￼ ￼. PT is not considered necessary for asymptomatic individuals or when the condition is not improving or is static ￼. Once maximal benefit is achieved or the patient can continue with a home exercise program, ongoing supervised PT is not considered medically necessary ￼.

Coverage Limits: Many Aetna plans (HMO, QPOS, etc.) limit outpatient PT to a 60-day treatment period per condition or per year ￼ ￼. For example, a patient may receive up to 60 consecutive days of PT for a specific injury; a new unrelated condition may qualify for a new 60-day course ￼. Some plans instead limit PT by number of visits per year or have a lifetime cap, so it’s important to check the member’s specific benefit plan ￼. Educational or vocational therapy services (e.g. school-based therapy not related to medical treatment) are generally excluded from coverage ￼ ￼. Maintenance therapy (where no further improvement is expected) and sports performance enhancement (beyond restoring normal ADLs) are not covered ￼ ￼.

Non-Covered Services: Aetna does not typically cover experimental or unproven therapies. For example, certain specialized techniques (e.g. McKenzie, Muldowney methods, Muscle Activation Techniques, Postural Restoration) are not deemed superior to standard PT, so going out-of-network for those specific methods isn’t considered necessary ￼ ￼. Some interventions are considered investigational or not medically necessary due to insufficient evidence, such as kinesio taping for various indications, blood flow restriction therapy, interactive metronome training, virtual reality gait training, and others ￼ ￼. These would not be reimbursed by Aetna. Additionally, augmented soft tissue mobilization (using handheld tools for myofascial release) is considered equivalent to standard manual therapy – it may be covered as normal myofascial release, but no extra payment for the tool itself ￼.

Documentation Requirements: Aetna emphasizes the need for detailed documentation. The plan of care should include diagnosis with onset date, short- and long-term functional goals that are objective and measurable, the treatment techniques/exercises planned, frequency and duration of treatment, and it must be signed by the PT ￼ ￼. Documentation should show objective progress towards goals at regular intervals (at least monthly), justifying continued treatment ￼. If progress plateaus or goals are met, continuation of PT is not covered ￼ ￼.

Reference Document: Cigna Medical Coverage Policy – Physical Therapy (CPG 135)

Visit and Unit Limits: Cigna covers outpatient and home PT under its “Short-Term Rehabilitative Therapy” benefit, often subject to visit limits and authorization requirements per plan. A key limitation in Cigna’s policy is that an outpatient PT session is limited to a maximum of 4 timed codes (approximately one hour) per day ￼ ￼. This means Cigna will not reimburse more than four 15-minute units of active therapy in a single visit. Any treatment extending beyond 4 timed units on one date of service is not covered or reimbursable ￼. Providers must plan their treatments accordingly (e.g. selecting up to four billable therapeutic interventions per session).

Non-Reimbursable Services: Cigna explicitly will not pay for certain modalities and services that it deems either unproven or not medically necessary. According to an update of the policy, Cigna does not reimburse the following treatments: infrared light therapy, vasopneumatic compression devices, work hardening programs, H-Wave electrical stimulation, dry needling, taping techniques, and low-level laser therapy ￼. These modalities are considered to have insufficient evidence or are considered educational/functional in nature rather than restorative. Indeed, the Cigna policy lists CPT code 97016 (vasopneumatic device) and 97026 (infrared therapy) as not medically necessary ￼ ￼. Also, general fitness programs, repetitive activities that patients can do independently, or duplicate services (e.g. performing the same exercises in PT that are being done in another setting) are not covered ￼ ￼. Services that are primarily educational, vocational, or recreational (e.g. “back school,” workplace ergonomic training, work hardening, or school-based therapy duplicated in outpatient) are excluded from coverage ￼ ￼.

Documentation Requirements: Cigna outlines detailed documentation expectations for PT:
	•	The initial evaluation and Plan of Care must include both long-term and short-term functional goals for the patient ￼.
	•	Routine treatment notes for each visit should record objective measures and total treatment time in minutes for timed codes ￼. (This aligns with Medicare’s 8-minute rule documentation; Cigna requires total timed minutes to ensure the 4-unit limit is not exceeded.)
	•	Progress reports are expected intermittently. While Cigna’s policy doesn’t prescribe an exact frequency, adopting Medicare’s standard of a progress note every 10 visits is suggested ￼. These reports should update the patient’s progress toward goals and justify ongoing therapy.
	•	A discharge summary is required at the conclusion of therapy, detailing outcomes and goal achievement ￼.

Adhering to these requirements is crucial for reimbursement. Claims submitted for services must include diagnosis codes and CPT codes that are covered under the policy, or they will be denied ￼. Providers are expected to use the most appropriate CPT codes and ensure the patient’s diagnosis is one of the covered conditions for PT – if a billed service isn’t tied to an approved diagnosis code, Cigna will deny it as not covered ￼.

Covered CPT Codes: Cigna’s policy includes a list of CPT codes considered medically necessary when coverage criteria are met. Common physical therapy CPT codes and their descriptions include ￼ ￼:
	•	97110 – Therapeutic Exercise, 15 min: Exercises to improve strength, endurance, range of motion, and flexibility ￼.
	•	97112 – Neuromuscular Re-education, 15 min: Activities to improve movement, balance, coordination, posture, or proprioception (e.g. balance training, stabilization exercises) ￼.
	•	97116 – Gait Training Therapy, 15 min: Training in ambulation techniques, use of assistive devices, stair climbing, etc. to improve walking ￼.
	•	97140 – Manual Therapy, 15 min: Hands-on mobilization/manipulation, manual lymphatic drainage, manual traction, etc., one or more regions ￼.
	•	97530 – Therapeutic Activities, 15 min: Direct performance of functional activities (e.g. bending, lifting, reaching tasks) to improve functional performance in daily tasks ￼.
	•	97535 – Self-Care/Home Management Training, 15 min: Training in ADLs, compensatory techniques, use of adaptive equipment, safety instructions – often for functional independence at home ￼.

Cigna will reimburse these and other standard PT codes as long as they are part of a medically necessary treatment plan and within the daily unit limits. Notably, passive modalities like 97010 (hot/cold packs) are listed in the code list ￼, but many payers (including Medicare) bundle 97010 into other services (no separate payment); Cigna’s policy doesn’t explicitly state if hot packs are separately reimbursed, but since it’s not listed as non-covered, it may be allowed although considered a modality with minimal value by many insurers. Cigna’s focus is clearly on active, skilled interventions.

Reference Document: UnitedHealthcare Policy (California) – Rehabilitation Services (PT/OT/ST)

UnitedHealthcare (UHC) administers PT benefits in line with federal/state mandates and its benefit plans. In California, UHC’s Benefit Interpretation Policy BIP147 (effective June 1, 2024) outlines state-specific coverage based on California’s health care requirements ￼ ￼.

State-Mandated Coverage (California): California law requires that basic health care services include physical therapy when medically necessary for health plan enrollees ￼ ￼. This means UHC’s California plans must cover PT that is medically necessary for diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury, including outpatient PT and home health PT, subject to usual cost-sharing and plan limits. For example, California’s regulations ensure that habilitative and rehabilitative therapy (PT, OT, ST) are part of essential health benefits for individual and small group plans ￼.

Standard Covered Benefits: UHC covers PT in various settings:
	•	Outpatient PT: The most common setting, provided it’s medically necessary. UHC generally aligns with the notion that therapy should result in significant improvement in a reasonable time. If the patient has reached goals or fails to improve, further therapy is not covered (maintenance care is excluded) ￼.
	•	Acute Inpatient Rehab: UHC covers intensive multidisciplinary rehab in a hospital for serious conditions (like post-stroke or traumatic injuries) when needed ￼.
	•	Home Health PT: PT provided at home can be covered under home health benefits if the patient is homebound or if outpatient services aren’t feasible ￼. If an independent PT (not affiliated with a home health agency) provides home therapy, it falls under outpatient rehab benefits ￼.
	•	Habilitative services: UHC covers therapy not just for rehabilitation (regaining lost function) but also habilitation (learning new function, e.g. in autism or developmental delays), in compliance with state mandates ￼ ￼.

Not Covered/Limitations: UHC does not cover:
	•	Therapy after goals attained or no progress: Once a member has met the therapy goals or if further progress is unlikely, ongoing therapy is considered not medically necessary ￼.
	•	Maintenance Therapy: Services aimed at maintaining current function (without expectation of improvement) are not covered ￼.
	•	Recreational or Vocational therapy: Therapy solely to improve performance in sports, recreation, or job skills is not covered ￼.
	•	Duplicate Therapy Services: If multiple providers or disciplines are providing overlapping services, UHC may not cover both. For example, if a patient is receiving PT and also chiropractic or acupuncture for the same condition, duplicative services might be scrutinized.

Utilization Management: UHC often requires prior authorization for PT beyond an initial evaluation or a certain number of visits. In 2024, UHC announced that for Medicare Advantage plans, prior authorization is required for outpatient PT/OT visits after the initial evaluation, effective Sept 1, 2024 ￼ ￼. The initial PT evaluation can be done without authorization (and is reimbursable as a one-time visit) ￼, but continued treatment visits must be authorized with submission of the eval findings and care plan ￼ ￼. For commercial UHC plans, many require prior authorization managed by third-party vendors (like Optum or OrthoNet). UHC in some regions contracts with utilization management companies to review PT necessity. If prior auth is not obtained when required, claims may be denied ￼ ￼. Providers have 10 days from the start of care to request retro-authorization if needed; failing to do so can result in non-payment ￼.

UHC no longer requires documenting “time in/time out” for each therapy session note on commercial plans as of mid-2024 (previously some UHC plans asked therapists to document session start and end times) ￼. However, therapists should still document total treatment minutes and services provided to support the CPT codes billed.

State Medicaid (Medi-Cal) Alignment: UHC’s Medicaid plans in CA (Medi-Cal managed care) must also follow Medi-Cal rules (see below). The UHC policy references California’s code, emphasizing that outpatient PT is part of basic benefits when needed ￼ ￼. For pediatric or developmental cases, UHC covers therapy per EPSDT requirements and autism mandates, etc., usually coordinating with state programs.

Reference Document: Physical Therapy Treatment Recommendations by Condition

Evidence-based guidelines and standard practices in physical therapy suggest specific treatments depending on the patient’s condition. Below are examples of recommended PT interventions for common conditions, illustrating what a thorough treatment plan might include:
	•	Low Back Pain (Chronic or Acute): Physical therapy for low back pain typically includes a combination of manual therapy, exercise, and education. Therapists may use manual therapy techniques including spinal mobilization or manipulation to improve joint mobility and reduce pain ￼. A program of specific strengthening and flexibility exercises is prescribed, tailored to the patient’s needs (e.g. core stabilization exercises to support the spine, hamstring/hip stretching if needed) ￼. Therapists provide education on proper body mechanics and posture – training the patient in how to lift, bend, sit, and sleep in positions that reduce strain on the back ￼. They also emphasize self-management strategies and pain neuroscience education (helping the patient understand pain and remain active within tolerance) ￼. Modalities like heat, ice, or electrical stimulation can be used adjunctively for pain relief ￼, though active treatments are primary. An overall physical activity program is introduced to improve fitness and prevent recurrence ￼. This multi-modal approach – exercise, manual therapy, and patient education – is supported by clinical guidelines as effective for low back pain ￼.
	•	Knee Meniscal Tear (Post-Injury or Post-Surgery): Physical therapy can often help manage meniscal tears conservatively and is crucial after meniscus surgery. Key components of PT for a meniscal injury include: Pain and swelling control – use of cryotherapy (icing) and compression wraps or sleeves to reduce knee swelling ￼ ￼. Therapists may guide patients in using assistive devices (crutches or braces) initially to protect the knee, if needed ￼. Manual therapy techniques can be applied to improve knee joint mobility and address soft tissue tightness (e.g. patellar mobilizations, knee joint mobilization) ￼ ￼. A graded exercise program is designed to restore strength (especially quadriceps and hamstrings) and range of motion in the knee ￼ ￼. Early exercises might be non-weight-bearing or closed-chain to protect the healing tissue, progressing to more functional strengthening. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is sometimes used on the quadriceps muscle after a knee injury/surgery to help re-engage the muscle and improve strength if there is inhibition ￼ ￼ (this is billed as e-stim modality). As recovery progresses, balance and proprioception training is added (e.g. single-leg stands, use of a balance board) to retrain knee stability. For athletic patients, the PT will incorporate sport-specific functional training (running, cutting drills) only when appropriate. Research indicates that a structured PT program can often restore function after meniscal injury and possibly prevent surgery; if surgery is done, PT both before (prehab) and after improves outcomes ￼ ￼.
	•	Shoulder Impingement Syndrome: PT is highly effective for shoulder impingement, aiming to reduce pain and improve subacromial space clearance through exercise and manual therapy. Key interventions include patient education to modify aggravating activities – for example, avoiding repetitive overhead motions or correcting poor posture that contributes to impingement ￼ ￼. Therapists focus on pain management strategies such as applying ice after activity and activity modification instead of relying on medications ￼ ￼. Range-of-motion exercises and stretches for the shoulder and thoracic spine are given to address any flexibility limitations (e.g. posterior capsule stretches, pec stretches) ￼. Manual therapy is employed to mobilize the shoulder joint and surrounding tissues; this may include glenohumeral joint mobilizations and scapular mobilization to improve mechanics ￼ ￼. To correct muscle imbalances, a muscle strengthening program is prescribed targeting the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers (mid-back and shoulder blade muscles) ￼ ￼. For example, strengthening the serratus anterior and lower trapezius helps normalize scapular motion and reduce impingement. As pain decreases and strength/mobility improve, PT will incorporate functional training – teaching proper movement patterns for overhead activities, lifting, or sports-specific motions to prevent recurrence ￼ ￼. This comprehensive approach addresses the root causes of impingement (posture, weak muscles, tight structures) and is shown to relieve symptoms and restore shoulder function in most cases, preventing the need for more invasive treatments.
