IMPORTANT: Generate exercises that are HIGHLY SPECIFIC to this patient's exact condition, goals, and any mentioned challenges. ${treatmentProgression ? 'Consider what has been tried and provide alternative or advanced approaches.' : ''}

Create 2-3 patient-specific exercises. Description MUST mention all exercise names naturally.

Each exercise needs:
- name: Specific exercise name
- description: 2-3 detailed sentences about technique and positioning
- cues: Object with exactly 3 cue types:
  * verbal: What to say to the patient (1-2 detailed sentences)
  * tactile: How to physically guide or touch the patient (1-2 detailed sentences)
  * visual: What to show or how to demonstrate (1-2 detailed sentences)
- documentation_examples: Array with 1 detailed clinical note (2-3 sentences) that includes a "show of skill" - meaning you MUST mention at least one specific cue the PT/OT used during the session and briefly explain why that cue was chosen or how it helped the patient
- cpt_codes: Array with 1 CPT code object containing the MOST APPROPRIATE code for THIS SPECIFIC exercise type:
  * code: The CPT code number (string) - MUST match the exercise type (e.g., 97140 for manual therapy, 97110 for therapeutic exercise, 97112 for neuromuscular re-education, 97530 for functional activities, 97116 for gait training, 97535 for ADL training, 97537 for community/work reintegration)
  * description: Brief description of the code
  * notes: Billing notes (e.g., "Per 15 minutes", "One or more regions")
- notes: 1 sentence about contraindications

IMPORTANT: Each exercise MUST have a DIFFERENT and APPROPRIATE CPT code based on the exercise type. DO NOT use 97110 for all exercises.

Format example (NOTE: Each exercise must have DIFFERENT CPT code appropriate to exercise type):
